# Technical Introduction
This section provides a technical introduction to the Paysafe Alternate Payments API.

## API Endpoints

The Paysafe Alternate Payments API is available in the Test environment for integration testing purposes.
To switch between the Test and the live Production systems you  need only to change the endpoint URI and the
credentials.

The following endpoints form the basis of a resource URI:

    Test endpoint &ndash; https://api.test.paysafe.com/alternatepayments/v1/<br/>
    Production endpoint &ndash; https://api.paysafe.com/alternatepayments/v1/

Because the Test environment is completely isolated, any changes you perform on your Test account configuration
(such as secure IP registration, APP registration, etc.) may have to be repeated in your Production account.


## Versioning

The API version will influence the request/response object structure as well as the functionality that is available through the API. A new version of the API will  be introduced only if we roll out a backwards-incompatible change
that may impact your existing integrations.

### Major Version

The major version \(i.e., /v1/ \) represents a major technology shift between versions of the API. Changes in the
major version are reserved for large-scale changes to the API that fundamentally change integration requirements
from the previous version.  Modified business domain models, re-design of functional flows, or change in API
resource patterns are all considered major changes.  Changes to a major version are rare and typically require
an extended deprecation cycle \(~2 years\) from prior versions to allow all consumers of the API to adapt.

> Your integration should take the following backwards-compatible changes into consideration so as not to break when additional fields are added to the API.

**What is considered a backwards-compatible change?**

* Adding API resources or adding new properties to existing API resources
* Modification to the order of parameters or JSON object elements
* Adding optional request parameters to API methods
* Adding webhook event types

**What is considered a backwards-incompatible change?**

* Removal of an API resource
* Removal of an API resources object attribute
* Changes to required parameter/JSON object elements
* Removal of previously supported API call

<a name="apikey" title="Authentication"></a>
## Authentication

In order for you to use the Paysafe REST API, Paysafe must first set you up on their system
and provide you with an API key. Your API key looks something like this:

> Key Username = MerchantXYZ<br/>
> Key Password = B-tst1-0-51ed39e4-312d02345d3f123120881dff9bb4020a89e8ac44cdfdcecd702151182fdc952272661d290ab2e5849e31bb03deede7e

Note that this is not the same as your Merchant Back Office username and password.
The case-sensitive API key is sent using HTTP Basic Authentication. To use HTTP Basic Authentication, you must send the API key credentials using the Authorization header with every request. The Authorization header is constructed as follows:
 1. The Key Username and Key Password are combined into a string separated by a colon, e.g.,“Key Username:Key Password”.
 2. The resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64.
 3. The authorization method and a space (i.e., “Basic”) are then put before the encoded string.

For example, using the Key Username and Password examples above, the header is formed as follows:

`Authorization: Basic TWVyY2hhbnRYWVo6Qi10c3QxLTAtNTFlZDM5ZTQtMzEyZDAyMzQ1ZDNmMTIzMTIwODgxZGZmOWJiNDAyMGE4OWU4YWM0NGNkZmRjZWNkNzAyMTUxMTgyZmRjOTU yMjcyNjYxZDI5MGFiMmU1ODQ5ZTMxYmIwM2RlZWRlN2U=`

For additional details, please refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

**Note:** Your Production API key will be different from your Test API key. Contact your account manager for details. You must keep your API keys safe and ensure that it is used appropriately for your needs.


<a name="pagination" title="Pagination"></a>
## Pagination

API calls that return multiple resources will wrap the response as a named JSON array.  For example, a collection of "payment" objects would
be returned as "payments". By default, 10 items at a time will be returned and you can navigate to the next set of resources using the
supplied HATEOAS links.  List responses will also include a meta data section that will identify the number of records included in the collection,
the number of records per page (limit), and the current page number.
<br/><br/>
For example, if a request to look up payments identifies that there are 134 payments and you have set your limit to 15, the first 15 items will be returned with navigation links to provide the next 15 items in the list. If you navigate to the next page using the provided HATEOAS link, you will then retrieve items 16-30 with a new navigation link provided to return to the previous page, as well as a link to continue to the next page of items.

> _You can change the default list page size by defining a **limit** parameter value._

|Parameter Name |Description|
|---            |---|
|limit          |The number of records to be returned per page. Default = 10, Max = 100|
|offset         |Identifies your location within the list and allows you to fetch the next set of resources|
|startDate      |This is the start date in UTC.|
|endDate        |This is the end date in UTC.|

## HTTP Responses

HTTP response codes are used to indicate the status of a request.

**HTTP Status Code Summary**

|HTTP Response Code Category|Description|
|---|---|
|1xx: Informational|Communicates transfer protocol–level information|
|2xx: Success|Indicates that the client’s request was accepted|
|3xx: Redirection|Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete the request|
|4xx: Client Error|Indicates that the client has made an error with the request|
|5xx: Server Error|Indicates that an error occurred on the server side|

**Common HTTP Response Status Codes**

|HTTP Status Code|Description|
|---|---|
|200 OK|Everything worked as expected.|
|201 CREATED|The request was successful. Paysafe created a new resource and the response body contains the representation.|
|202 ACCEPTED|This indicates that the client’s request will be handled asynchronously. It tells the client that the request appears valid, but it still may have problems once it is processed.|
|204 NO CONTENT|This is usually returned in response to a PUT, POST, or DELETE request, when the REST API declines to send back any status message or representation in the body of the response message.|
|304 NOT MODIFIED|The client's cached version of the representation is still up to date.|
|400 BAD REQUEST|This often indicates that a required parameter is missing or that a parameter is invalid. This is a generic client-side error status, used when no other 4xx error code is appropriate.|
|401 UNAUTHORIZED|This indicates that the client tried to operate on a protected resource without providing the proper authorization. They may have provided the wrong credentials or none at all.|
|402 PAYMENT REQUIRED|The parameters were valid but the request failed.|
|404 NOT FOUND|The requested resource does not exist.|
|405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED|The client tried to POST or PUT to a resource that would not accept it.|
|409 CONFLICT|The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource. This code is used in situations where the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request.|
|415 UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE|The request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method.|
|429 TOO MANY REQUESTS|The application is sending too many simultaneous requests.|
|500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR|An error occurred with an internal server.|
|502 EXTERNAL SERVER ERROR|We received an invalid response from the upstream gateway in attempting to fulfill the request.|


## HATEOAS

The Alternate Payments API uses a RESTful endpoint structure and relies on HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
to determine what action you are attempting to perform on a specific resource.

Each API call response includes an array of HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) links.
These links can be used to integrate subsequent flows and typically they will provide you information as to
what you can do next.  Additionally these links might be used to link to other resources related to the
current response object.

By using these links, you no longer need to hardcode your integration to call specific endpoint URLs to utilize
our API, but rather can use the returned URL for the specific purpose as defined by the 'rel' definition.

#### HATEOAS Link Structure

|Element  |Description|
|---      |---|
|rel      |Link relation that describes how this link relates to the previous call. Examples include self (get details of the current call), parent_payment (get details of the parent payment), or a related call such as to execute a refund on the payment.|
|href     |URL of the related HATEOAS link you can use for subsequent calls.|


Below are sample HATEOAS links from an API response that returns a collection of payments associated to a specific merchant reference. Links
are provided to navigate through the set of resources in the collection.

```
GET https://api.test.paysafe.com/v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/payments?merchantRefNum={MERCHANT_REF_NUM}&limit=10&offset=10

...result set

"links": [{
    "rel": "self",
    "href": "https://api.test.paysafe.com/v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/payments?merchantRefNum={MERCHANT_REF_NUM}&limit=10&offset=10"
},  {
    "rel": "prev",
    "href": "https://api.test.paysafe.com/v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/payments?merchantRefNum={MERCHANT_REF_NUM}&limit=10&offset=0"
}, {
    "rel": "next",
    "href": "https://api.test.paysafe.com/v1/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/payments?merchantRefNum={MERCHANT_REF_NUM}&limit=10&offset=20"
}]
```

# Resource Hierarchy and State Transition

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_alternatepayments_v1/raw/master/images/ap_resource_hierarchy.png)

Some resources in the system can transition through various statuses depending on the current state of the resource.  The diagrams below show the
valid statuses for these complex resources and how they are linked.

# Notifications

You can configure custom notification events for your account(s) from the merchant backoffice.  Notification events could include webhooks, email, and/or SMS.  The availibity of notification types will vary
depending upon your account type and setup.
<br/>

The most common notification used as part of your Alternate Payments integration comes in the form of a webhook.  A webhook allows you to define an HTTP callback that will be POST to when
an event occurs that you would like to be notified of.  This would typically include status changes to a payment request.   As many alternate payment flows involve redirecting your customer
to a third-party site, you have no guarantee they will be properly returned to your site once payment is completed.   For these situations you should make use of webhook notifications.

Notifications are configured by logging into the merchant backoffice and navigating to the <i>Settings --> Notifications</i> section.
<br/>
> NOTE: Access to this function is dependent upon your user account privileges.  If you are unable to access this function please contact your merchant account support representative for assistance.

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_alternatepayments_v1/raw/master/images/webhooks_sample.png)

<b>Supported Webhook Event Types</b>

|Event|Description|
|---|---|
|AP\_PAYMENT\_PROCESSING|The Alternate Payments authorization was requested but is still to be accessed by the downstream PSP.|
|AP\_PAYMENT\_COMPLETED|The Alternate Payments authorization was successful.|
|AP\_PAYMENT\_FAILED|The Alternate Payments authorization was declined or rejected.|
|AP\_PAYMENT\_CANCELLED|The Alternate Payments authorization was cancelled.  This is usually the result of a voidauth in a manual settlement transaction.|
|AP\_PAYMENT\_ERRORED|The Alternate Payments authorization has failed due to an error.|
|AP\_PAYMENT\_EXPIRED|The Alternate Payments authorization has expired.|
|AP\_REFUND\_COMPLETED|The Alternate Payments refund was successful.|
|AP\_REFUND\_FAILED|The Alternate Payments refund was declined or rejected.|
|AP\_REFUND\_CANCELLED|The Alternate Payments refund was cancelled.|
|AP\_REFUND\_ERRORED|The Alternate Payments refund has failed due to an error.|
|AP\_REFUND\_EXPIRED|The Alternate Payments refund request has expired. This will only occur if the refund was left in PENDING or PROCESSING state for an extended period of time and never finished.|
|AP\_RETURN\_COMPLETED|The downstream PSP has notified of a credit loss.|
|AP\_RETURN\_REVERSAL\_COMPLETED|The downstream PSP has notified of a late credit and is reversing a previous credit loss notice.|
|AP\_SETTLEMENT\_PENDING|The Alternate Payments settlement is pending batch processing.|
|AP\_SETTLEMENT\_PROCESSING|The Alternate Payments settlement request was received and is in progress.|
|AP\_SETTLEMENT\_COMPLETED|The Alternate Payments settlement was successfully processed.|
|AP\_SETTLEMENT\_FAILED|The Alternate Payments settlement was declined or rejected.|
|AP\_SETTLEMENT\_CANCELLED|The Alternate Payments settlement was cancelled.|
|AP\_SETTLEMENT\_ERRORED|The Alternate Payments settlement has failed due to an error.|
|AP\_SETTLEMENT\_EXPIRED|The Alternate Payments settlement has expired. This typically will only occur on a settle with auth request and the auth was never completed (abandoned by user).|
|AP\_VOIDAUTH\_COMPLETED|The Alternate Payments voidauth was successfully processed.|
|AP\_VOIDAUTH\_ERRORED|The Alternate Payments voidauth was unsuccessful due to error.|
|AP\_VOIDAUTH\_FAILED|The Alternate Payments voidauth was declined.|

<b>Wehooks Signature Validation</b>

When you register an endpoint in the merchant back office, Paysafe will automatically generate an HMAC Secret Key that you can use to validate the authenticity of the notifications you receive.
Notification payloads will include a signature as part of the header response. When you receive a webhook notification, you can validate the signature by using your HMAC Secret Key using the following
logic:

digest = HMAC_SHA256 (Secret Key, UTF string)
signature = base64 (digest)

<br/>
<b><i>Sample Webhook Signature</i></b>

![](https://github.com/paysafegroup/paysafe_api_alternatepayments_v1/raw/master/images/sample_wh_signature.png)

<br/>
> The following code example shows how to calculate the HMAC signature using Java.

```
/**
  * calculating the HMAC signature.
  *
  * digest = HMAC-SHA256 ( secret key, UTF8 string )
  *
  * signature = base64 ( digest )
  *
  * @param hmacKey key
  * @param msg message
  * @return Base64 encoded string
  */
 public static String generateHmacSignature(final String hmacKey, final String msg) {
   final byte[] key = Base64.decodeBase64(hmacKey);
   final byte[] hmac = HmacUtils.hmacSha256(key, msg.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
   return Base64.encodeBase64String(hmac);
 }
 ```

# Error Summary

To ease integration and support for developers
integrating to our APIs, the error messages that are returned should be verbose enough to correct the problem.

> See [error Object](#error)

The error structure contains a code as well as a human readable message.
Additionally, the application error code will be returned in the header as *x-application-error-code*
so it can be easily used by an application without parsing the body.

# Verify That the Service Is Accessible [GET /monitor]

This call returns a status of READY if the API is available.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

                "status" : "READY"
            }

# Payments [/payments]
<a name="payments" title="Payments"></a>

The payments resource represents a Payment Authorization.

A Payment and Settlement work in conjunction and a complete transaction will always have both resources associated to it (Payment + Settlement).

When requesting a payment, by default it will include automatic Settlement (*settleWithAuth* = *true*). This will trigger creation of a corresponding Settlement record.  The
Settlement record represents the actual capture of funds to your merchant account. For cases  when *settleWithAuth* is *true*, the corresponding Settlement will have the same
resource identifier (ID) as the payment because it was created from the same request.

Alternatively, you can choose manual Settlement (*settleWithAuth* = *false*). In this case, the Payment only represents an Authorization for the Payment and you must complete
a subsequent Settlement request when you wish to capture the payment.  The ability to perform manual Settlement will depend on the payment option you are attempting.
[Click here](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-api/alternate-payments/getting-started/overview/) to see which payment types support manual settlement.

> **Note:** Each payment type and currency is associated with a distinct merchant account ID.  You will need to know which account ID is associated to your payment type and currency
> in order to complete your request. Please contact [Paysafe Merchant Support](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/resources-and-support/contact-us/) to enable additional payment types and or currencies.


## Create an Authorized Payment [POST /accounts/{accountId}/payments]
<a name="createauthorization" title="Create an Authorized Payment"></a>

Submit a payment request using local payment methods that your customers are familiar with.
Once you have submited your request, if you are returned a *redirect_payment* HATEOAS link, then you must redirect
your consumer to the link to complete the payment.

In addition to specifying *paymentType* as part of your API request, if the desired payment method also requires additional attributes,
these should be passed as a nested object in the root of your payment request.
<br/>
For example, a SOFORT payment can support the following attributes to be included in your request:

```
{
    "paymentType": "SOFORT",
    "sofort": {
       "sepa": {
           "bankName": "ing",
           "country": "NL"
       }
    }
    ... other payment attributes here ...
```

See [Payment Objects](#paymentObjects) for payment type specific details, or select a payment type below.

# Verifications [/verifications]
<a name="verifications" title="Verifications"></a>

A Verification request allows you to send a query to do a preliminary check to verify the consumer's request (e.g., verify that the profile and payment method information are valid). When you get a successful response, you can then continue and [process a Payment Authorization](#createauthorization).

**Note:** Verification requests are currently supported for the PAYOLUTION *paymentType* only. It is required if your *productType* for your Authorized Payment is *INSTALLMENTS*. However, payolution recommends that you also process a Verification request when your *productType* is *INVOICE*.

When payolution responds to the Verification request, they will indicate 1) whether the consumer information is valid; and 2) whether the consumer is eligible for credit.
In the case where the *productType* in the Verification response is *INSTALLMENTS*, payolution will also return the available payment plans with all the payment details, which should be presented to the consumer so they can select a payment plan duration. The selected duration is then passed with the *planDuration* parameter in the [Authorized Payment request](#createauthorization).

See the [payolution payment object](#payolution) for more information.

# Void Authorizations [/voidauths]
<a name="voidauths" title="Void Authorizations"></a>

This is how you submit a Void Authorization (authorization reversal) request. You can void an Authorization only if it has not yet been settled.

**Note:** This operation is available only for payment methods that [support manual Settlement](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-api/alternate-payments/getting-started/overview). If the authorization has already been fully settled, then you will not be able to void it and will need to [issue a Refund](#refundpayment) instead.

# Settlements [/settlements]
<a name="settlements" title="Settlements"></a>

If you specified manual Settlement on your payment request (i.e., with *settleWithAuth* = *false*), then you must manually POST the Settlement against
the Payment Authorization.  Settlement is the process of capturing funds from a previous authorization request to your merchant account. You can query the
Payment resource to find out the remaining amount available to settle.

You can settle all or part of an existing Payment Authorization. [Click here](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-api/alternate-payments/getting-started/overview/) to see which payment types support manual settlement.

# Refunds [/refunds]
<a name="refunds" title="Refunds"></a>

A Refund allows you to refund back to a consumer an amount that has previously been settled. You can issue either a full or a
partial Refund (or series of Refunds) against the initial Settlement, provided the combined Refund amount does not
exceed the original Settlement amount.

You can create a Refund against either an Authorized Payment or a Settlement. **Note:** If you process a partial Refund against a Settlement using the *settlements/settlementId/refunds* endpoint, if you want to Refund any of the remaining amount you must use the same endpoint. Similarly, if you process a partial Refund against a Payment Authorization using the *payments/paymentId/refunds* endpoint, if you want to Refund any of the remaining amount you must use the same endpoint.
